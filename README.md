# Hashing

This repository provides a brief overview and implementation of hashing in various programming languages. 

## What is Hashing?

Hashing is a technique used in computer science to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. It is commonly used in data structures like hash tables to store and retrieve data efficiently.

## How Does Hashing Work?

In hashing, a hash function takes an input (such as a string or an object) and produces a unique hash value of fixed length. The hash value is typically used as an index or key to store and retrieve data in a data structure.

## Why Use Hashing?

Hashing provides several benefits:
- Efficient data storage and retrieval: Hashing allows for constant-time (O(1)) insertion, deletion, and retrieval of data in hash-based data structures.
- Data integrity: Hash functions generate unique hash values for different inputs, making it useful for verifying data integrity and detecting changes or tampering.
- Password storage: Hashing is commonly used to securely store passwords by converting them into hash values, protecting them from being easily reverse-engineered.
